# MatBase: A comprehensive MATerials DataBASE for photoelectron spectroscopy

MatBase is an app that allows you to explore and analyze the properties and behaviors of various materials using MATLAB. You can use this app to:  
- Access a comprehensive database of material properties and photoelectron spectroscopy parameters, and edit it as you wish.  
- Visualize and manipulate crystal structures in both real and reciprocal space, and calculate the Brillouin zone and 2D slices.  
- Compute the electron inelastic mean free path for different materials using various formalisms, such as the Universal, TPP-2M, S1, and S2 methods.  
- Extract the binding energy spectrum, photoionization cross-sections, and photoionization asymmetry parameters of all elements from 1 to 118.  
This app is designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts who are interested in learning more about the physical and chemical properties of materials. Whether you are working on a project, studying for an exam, or just curious about the world of materials science and photoelectron pectroscopy, this app can help you find the information and tools you need. Download MatBase today and discover the fascinating world of materials science!

## List of Available Databases  
- Material Properties Database (MPD):This is a local MATLAB database that compiles the most useful physical, electronic, optical and magnetic material properties of elements / compounds. The data is taken from a range of sources, where the 'average' values are used for parameters that had more than 1 unique value. Accessible in MATLAB via 'get_mpd_props()'.  

- Electron Inelastic Mean Free Path Database (eIMFPD): This is a local MATLAB database that compiles the optical data from the NIST Electron Inelastic-Mean-Free-Path Database (http://dx.doi.org/10.18434/T48C78) so that the results can be easily called and accessed within MATLAB. This is accessible in MATLAB via 'get_eimfpd_props()'. Furthermore, predictive eIMFP formulas's are also available using the (1) Universal, (2) TPP-2M and (3) S1 & S2 formalisms.  

- Photoionisation Cross-Section and Asymmetry Database (PIXSAD); This is a local MATLAB database that compiles the photoionisation cross-section and asymmetry parameter data of the elements. This is useful when modelling the total photoelectron intensity that originates from a given layer of a sample when performing ARPES / XPS experiments. Accessible in MATLAB via 'get_pixsad_props()'.   

- Photoionisation Energy and Fluorescence Database (PIEFD); This is a local MATLAB database that compiles the photoionisation energy and fluorescence yield data of the elements. Accessible in MATLAB via 'get_piefd_props()'.
